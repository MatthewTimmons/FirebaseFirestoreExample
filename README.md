# FirebaseFirestoreExample
This is an application that I made for a presentation on Firebase Firestore. You can clone or download the repo to find the starting point of this demo. There are TODO sections throughout the code that will prompt you to implement the new Firebase Firestore skills you learn through this tutorial.

The YouTube tutorial video that accompanies this project can be found below:
